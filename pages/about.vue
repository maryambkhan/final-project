                Hello and welcome to ABK Photos. My name is Atika Khan. I was
                born in Pakistan and moved to Canada when I was nine. From a
                young age, I enjoyed anything and everything to do with art,
                creativity and hands-on activities. I practised sketching,
                painting, and got a diploma in Architectural Photography in
                2021. A few years ago, I found my way to a camera and realised I
                loved capturing moments. Thus began my photography journey. I
                first practised the craft of photography at family gatherings,
                eventually compelling friends and family members to model for
                portraits! Since then I have come to photograph wedding events,
                and family portraits.
              </p>

                I also love to travel and explore nature via hiking - which
                gives me a chance to refine my skills in landscape and still
                life photography in addition to portraiture. I am excited to add
                new locations to my travel photography!
