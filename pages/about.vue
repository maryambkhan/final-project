              Hello and welcome to ABK Photos. My name is Atika Khan. I was born
              in Pakistan and moved to Canada when I was nine. From a young age,
              I enjoyed anything and everything to do with art, creativity and
              hands-on activities. I practised sketching, painting, and got a
              diploma in Architectural Photography in 2021. A few years ago, I
              found my way to a camera and realised I loved capturing moments.
              Thus began my photography journey. I first practised the craft of
              photography at family gatherings, eventually compelling friends
              and family members to model for portraits! Since then I have come
              to photograph wedding events, and family portraits.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also love to travel and explore nature via hiking - which gives
              me a chance to refine my skills in landscape and still life
              photography in addition to portraiture. I am excited to add new
              locations to my travel photography!
