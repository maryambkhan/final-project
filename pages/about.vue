            Hello and welcome to ABK Photos. My name is Atika Khan. I was born
            in Pakistan and moved to Canada when I was nine. From a young age, I
            enjoyed anything and everything to do with art, creativity and
            hands-on activities. I practised sketching, painting, and got a
            diploma in Architectural Photography in 2021. A few years ago, I
            found my way to a camera and realised I loved capturing moments.
            Thus began my photography journey. I first practised the craft of
            photography at family gatherings, eventually compelling friends and
            family members to model for portraits! Since then I have come to
            photograph wedding events, and family portraits.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also love to travel and explore nature via hiking - which gives me
            a chance to refine my skills in landscape and still life photography
            in addition to portraiture. I am excited to add new locations to my
            travel photography!
