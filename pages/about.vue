        Hello and welcome to ABK Photos. My name is Atika Khan. I was born in
        Pakistan and moved to Canada when I was nine. From a young age, I
        enjoyed anything and everything to do with art, creativity and hands-on
        activities. I practised sketching, painting, and got a diploma in
        Architectural Photography in 2021. A few years ago, I found my way to a
        camera and realised I loved capturing moments. Thus began my photography
        journey. I first practised the craft of photography at family
        gatherings, eventually compelling friends and family members to model
        for portraits! Since then I have come to photograph wedding events, and
        family portraits.</p>
				<p> I also love to travel and explore nature via hiking -
        which gives me a chance to refine my skills in landscape and still life
        photography in addition to portraiture. I am excited to add new
        locations to my travel photography!
      </p>
