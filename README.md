### Journel Entries

- We are done with all the documentation for final project.
- I created Nuxt2 project and added google image and tailwindcss.
- Then just to make sure everything is working i added nav-bar component but i could not see it. First thing i did was check
  nuxtconfig and make sure everything was okay.
- Created a rough structure of navigation bar
- Next i an going make this nav-bar mobile version.
- Followed a youtube video for mobile nav-bar it was reall good and i got it done the way i wanted yay!.
- I have started working on about page added navbar footer and content so far so good.
### Problems

- I just had this silly problem where i was not able to see nav-bar on html page. All of sudden idea struck me if
  inspect the page and see if it is rendring on page or not. Well it was and then i went back to VS and saw nav-bar
  color was white.
